        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            Music Pirates is a website where you can find the music you love without
            having to subscribe to multiple streaming services just for one album.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you want to listen to your favorite music, you should not have to
            subscribe to or use multiple streaming platforms. That's why we made
            <em>Music Pirates</em>. We will pull songs from your favorite artists
            from Spotify, Youtube, and more. You can make playlists of all your
            favorite kinds of music and also follow playlists that others have
            made and the creators of those playlists. We hope to expand our website
            to include more and more streaming platforms as we continue to work
            on this website. <em>We steal the music so you don't have to! </em> ;)
        </p>

            This website was created by Salem Najera, Ben Stover, Brandon Rankin,
            and Misha Finley for our Web-Based Software Projects class at Neumont
            College of Computer Science. We are excited for the outcome of this
            website and hope to continue working on this website and making it
            better and better, even after our class has ended!
